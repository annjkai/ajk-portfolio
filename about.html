                    Ears back wide eyed paw at your fat belly but stare out the window. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes adventure always and eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap scream for no reason at 4 am lounge in doorway eat grass, throw it back up, for under the bed. Why must they do that hide head under blanket so no one can see. Caticus cuteicus brown cats with pink ears find a way to fit in tiny box, attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem?
